Asset Allocation: Detailed breakdown of investments across equity (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap) and commodities (gold, silver, oil, coffee, etc.), tailored to each risk profile.
Custom Investment Filter: An interactive filter allows users to simulate potential returns based on custom investment amounts, giving a personalized look at outcomes.
Profit/Loss Projections: After 10 years, users can view projected profit and potential losses to better understand long-term impacts.
